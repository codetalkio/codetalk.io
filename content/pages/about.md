## About the blog

Codethoughts is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings from my journey as a Engineering Leader, Solo Founder, and Software Engineer. I write about engineering leadership, development and architecture (both high and low-level), and personal growth. I hope you find something useful here!

For some of my other stuff, check out my GitHub Projects both [Personal](https://github.com/Tehnix) and in the [codetalkio organization](https://github.com/codetalkio).
