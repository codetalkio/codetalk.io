This blog will mostly serve as a personal memory pad. I often discover a process, learn something new or just am plain forgetful. Therefore I'll try to write down various things that I learn during my journey as a programmer and enthusiast on all things technical.

With that in mind, the idea is to make the content posted here general enough so that any random Google'er would also be able to understand it.

What will be on here? Mostly things related to programming and technology. What I learn is almost always related to some hobby project I got going on.

Another thing I'll try to do is post upfront whatever version of tools or libraries I might be using throughout that post. Far too often has it bothered me that I didn't know what version an article or tutorial applied to, or had in mind, and because of that, one might be doing something that was solved in later versions of said library or tool.

# A little background on me

_Updated on 21st of March, 2020._

I'm primarily self-taught, and started my venture out with PHP and the web dev stack (JS, HTML and CSS). This also got me my first programming related jobs, and I've been grateful for that. Later on, Python came into the scene along with plethora of other languages. All in the imperative end of things though.

After starting university, which I graduated start 2018, I started getting more interested in declarative and functional programming. Mainly Haskell. Type-level programming and working with GHC is quite a joy, especially the level of assurance the compiler gives when writing programs. Correctness by construction is a key-concept I keep coming back to.

Both during university and before, I have been working professionally as a Software Engineer, giving me many years of experience. Especially in web development. After graduating I immediately began working as a Full-stack Engineer, which later lead me on to become the Director of Development at the company. This meant growing in more directions than just technical skills, and has allowed me to grow as a leader, mentor and friend for my colleagues. The technical part is still what I enjoy though, and a large part of my work is still focused on this.

I'll be trying to update this blog as much as time allows. Hopefully there'll be something interesting on here from time to time.
