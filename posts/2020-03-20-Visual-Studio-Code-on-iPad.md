*Versions and Tools used:*

- *`code-server` Version 3.0.0*
- your own server
- your own domain

With [Apple increasing their focus](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/03/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-lidar-scanner-and-trackpad-support-in-ipados/) on making the iPad a viable device for work, it is time to revisit using my iPad as a workstation for programming.

I rely heavily on command-line tools and language specific tools (rust-analyser, node, ghcide, etc) for my day-to-day programming, and my current setup features:

- Blink with mosh to a remote server
- Neovim and [wemux]() on the remote server
- iSH to play around with very simple CLI needs locally on the iPad

On my computer I use Visual Studio Code, and its long been a wish to get that running somehow on my iPad. This is an attempt to make VS Code available on the iPad, under the restrictions that we have to deal with.

  This setup unfortunately doesn't eliminate the need for a server yet! We'll have to dream of that day to come.

## Enter code-server
[code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) enables you to run VS Code on a remote server, and access it through a browser. While not ideal, this is at least one way to get VS Code onto an iPad.

I'll assume you have a server running somewhere, that you intend to use for this setup.

First, SSH into your server, so that we can setup `code-server`. We are going to download the latest release from GitHub, and set it up. Checkout the latest release at [https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases), and pick the asset for `linux_x86_64`,

```bash
$ ssh user@example.com
$ wget https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/3.0.0/code-server-3.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar.gz
...
code-server-3.0.0-linux-x86_6 100%[==============================================>]  64.31M  3.47MB/s    in 9.4s
$ tar -zxvf code-server-3.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

You should now have a folder called `code-server-3.0.0-linux-x86_64`. Let's rename it and make the put the executable on our `PATH`,

```bash
$ mv code-server-3.0.0-linux-x86_64 .code-server
$ ln -s "$HOME/.code-server" /usr/local/bin/code-server
```

Try firing it up,

```bash
$ code-server
info  code-server 3.0.0
info  Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
info    - Password is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
info      - To use your own password, set the PASSWORD environment variable
info      - To disable use `--auth none`
info    - Not serving HTTPS
info    - Automatic updates are enabled
```

Neat! ðŸ™‚

## Securing the setup for remote access
So far `code-server` is only listening for local connections, but we'd like to be able to use it on the go, from a browser on the iPad. This means we have to do a little extra work to secure our setup.

`code-server` covers how to do this [in their FAQ](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#how-should-i-expose-code-server-to-the-internet), but skips the specific steps. Unfortunately, due to an issue with self-signed certificates on iOS, we cannot simply use these (see [code-serfer#1122](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/1122)). Instead, we will opt for [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)!

<!--
We'll set up a self-signed certificate. For the pass phrase, simply press enter to put a blank password on the key.

```bash
$ mkdir .code-server-meta
$ cd .code-server-meta
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/C=NA/ST=None/L=Global/O=Company Name/OU=Org/CN=localhost"
Generating a RSA private key
...
```

Here we made a directory to hold our keys for `code-server`, and generated them using `openssl`. You can adjust the days to a number you are comfortable with, here I just went with 365, meaning I'll have to renew the certificate in a year.
-->

First we will install certbot, which will manage the certificate renewal on our server,

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common # for add-apt-repository
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt install python-certbot-nginx
```

Because these certificates are managed under `certbot`, we'll need to setup a script that will move the certificates to a location we want, so that our `code-server` does not need root permissions. We'll do this with a [deploy-hook](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewing-certificates), which runs after each successful renewal.

Let's make a directory for the certificates. For convenience we will also export our domain name as an environment variables, to be used throughout the rest of the post (change `vscode.example.com` to your own domain),

```bash
$ mkdir .code-server-meta
$ cd .code-server-meta
$ export DOMAIN=vscode.example.com
```

Let's set up the renewal script in `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/renewal.sh`,

```bash
$ echo 'echo '\''#!/bin/bash
echo "Letsencrypt renewal hook running..."
echo "RENEWED_DOMAINS=$RENEWED_DOMAINS"
echo "RENEWED_LINEAGE=$RENEWED_LINEAGE"

if [[ $RENEWED_LINEAGE == *"'$DOMAIN'"* ]]; then
  cat $RENEWED_LINEAGE/privkey.pem > '$HOME'/.code-server-meta/key.pem
  cat $RENEWED_LINEAGE/fullchain.pem > '$HOME'/.code-server-meta/cert.pem
  systemctl restart code-server
  echo "code-server cert and key updated and restarted"
fi'\'' > /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/renewal.sh' | sudo bash && sudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/renewal.sh
```

We'll now set up our certificates by starting `certbot`. During this you will be asked for your email, and to agree to the terms of service.

```bash
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d $DOMAIN
```

This will create the certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN`. Check that everything works by doing a dry-run of the certificate renewal,

```bash
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

Excellent. You are now ready to launch your `code-server` instance using the keys for HTTPS,

```bash
$ code-server --cert ~/.code-server-meta/cert.pem --cert-key ~/.code-server-meta/key.pem --host 0.0.0.0
info  code-server 3.0.0
info  Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
info    - Password is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
info      - To use your own password, set the PASSWORD environment variable
info      - To disable use `--auth none`
info    - Automatic updates are enabled
```

A login screen should appear. Use the password that the server printed, and you are in! ðŸ¥³

## Daemonizing the server
Currently we need to manually start the server every time we reboot our server. Instead of this, we'd like the `code-server` to be managed as a system service.

We'll do this by:

- Start `code-server` with a fixed password
- Setting up a script to start `code-server` in a `screen` instance
- Letting `systemd` manage the start/stop of the service

**Passphrase**

First let us set up our password for the `code-server`, so that we can login across reboots. We'll do this by dropping a simple plaintext file inside `$HOME/.code-server-meta`.

This is under the assumption that you are the only one with access to the server. It is recommended that you put a unique passphrase for this service.

```bash
$ echo "MySecretPassword" > $HOME/.code-server-meta/passphrase.txt
```

**Manage code-server in screen**

We are going to put our script to manage the `code-server` instance in `$HOME/.code-server-meta/service.sh`.

```bash
$ echo '#!/bin/bash

case "$1" in
  start)
    # Create a screen in detached mode, called "code-server"
    screen -dmS code-server bash -c '\''PASSWORD=$(cat $HOME/.code-server-meta/passphrase.txt) code-server --cert $HOME/.code-server-meta/cert.pem --cert-key ~/.code-server-meta/key.pem --host 0.0.0.0'\''
    echo "Service started."
    ;;
  status)
    result=$(screen -list | grep code-server)
    if [ $? == 0 ]; then
      echo "code-server service is ON."
    else
      echo "code-server service is OFF."
    fi
    ;;
  stop)
    # Quit the "code-server" screen
    screen -S code-server -X quit
    echo "Service stopped."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown command: $1"
    exit 1
  ;;
esac
' > $HOME/.code-server-meta/service.sh && chmod +x $HOME/.code-server-meta/service.sh
```

**Systemd service**

Finally, we are gonna put our `systemd` service in `/etc/systemd/system/code-server.service`.

```bash
$ echo "echo '[Unit]
Description=Service to run code-server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=$(whoami)
ExecStart=$HOME/.code-server-meta/service.sh start
ExecStop=$HOME/.code-server-meta/service.sh stop
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
' > /etc/systemd/system/code-server.service" | sudo bash
```

Enable the script and start the service,

```bash
$ systemctl enable code-server
$ systemctl start code-server
```

Navigate to your domain on port `8080`. Congratulations, you've now got a solid setup for editing code in your iPad browser ðŸŽ‰
